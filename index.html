      <h2>What</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="//fml.network">fml.network</a> is a VPN set up by a few people from planet earth. We
      don't want to hide our identities, or change our digital location - we are just exploring networking 
      and learning about IPv6 routing as we go.
      </p>

      <h2>Who</h2>
      <p>
        <ul class="flat-list">
          <li><a href="//tkw01536.de">Tom Wiesing</a> is a PhD candidate in the KWARC Group at FAU Erlangen-N&uuml;rnberg</li>
          <li><a href="//kuboschek.me">Leonhard Kuboschek</a> consults with financial service providers during the day</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>Why</h2>
      <p>
        Centralization has encircled most common internet applications - sharing files, thoughts and ideas
        is increasingly performed via large service providers with commercial interests. We aim to provide a 
        platform to facilitate exchange of ideas and thoughts without the middlemen.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, building our own routed VPN has provided us with ample insights into the workings of
        networking technology - far beyond the theoretical knowledge from Computer Networks classes.
